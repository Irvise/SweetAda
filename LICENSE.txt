SweetAda is composed of three software components: core, RTS and LibGCC.

1 - core)

The "core" is the whole SweetAda codebase. A core file is every file in the
SweetAda filesystem hierarchy, except those specified in 2) and 3).

3 - LibGCC)

LibGCC files are a small set of assembly/C files insterspersed in the various
cpus/<cpu> subdirectories, extracted from a GCC standard FSF release. SweetAda
LibGCC files are only a source code re-formatted and cleaned-up version, with
minor changes, and suitable for a compile-time build. These files are not
strictly needed if you want to link the SweetAda executable with the binary
form of the library normally present in the compiler toolchain.

All LibGCC assembly/C files have thair own license, i.e, GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
