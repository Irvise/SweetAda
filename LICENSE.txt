plus some utilities and/or fragments of software code.

SweetAda filesystem hierarchy, except those specified below.

LibGCC files are only a source code re-formatted and cleaned-up version, with
minor changes, and suitable for a compile-time build. These files are not
strictly needed if you want to link the SweetAda executable with the binary
